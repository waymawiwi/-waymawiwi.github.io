<h1><b> This is <i>still</i> a motherfucking website </b> </h1> 

<p> And it's more fucking perfect than the last guy's.</p>

<h1> Seriously, it takes minimal fucking effort to improve this shit.</h1>

<h4> 7 fucking declarations.</h4>
<p> That's how much CSS it took to turn that <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">grotesque pile of shit <a/>  into this easy-to-read masterpiece. It's so fucking simple and it <i> still </i> has all the glory of the original perfect-ass website:<p/>
<ul>
 <li> Shit's <i>still</i> lightweight and loads fast </li>
  <li>  <i>still</i> fits on all your shitty screens </li>
  <li> <i>still</i> looks the same in all your shitty browsers </li>
  <li>The motherfucker's <i>still</i> accessible to every asshole that visits your site </li>
  <li> Shit's <i>still</i> legible and gets your fucking point across </li>
 </ul>
 
 <h3> And guess what, motherfucker:</h2>
 <p> You never knew it, but it's easy to improve readability on your site. Here's how.</p>
 
 <h3> Let it breathe </h3>
 <p> Look at lines 1 and 2 of some shitty website you're building. 
 <br> Assuming they're not married they probably shouldn't be humping. 
 <br> The defaults are trash -- pick a minimum line-height: 1.4 for body copy. Headings should be tighter. If you can't see that...piss off.

 <br> if your text hits the side of the browser, fuck off forever. You ever see a book like that? Yes? What a shitty book. </p>
